# Contributing to ShuttleAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ShuttleAI project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

*We are in the midst of remaking the wrapper, your help with adding previous endpoints to the new wrapper is needed!*

The ShuttleAI Python SDK uses poetry as previously discussed, on top of this, we use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting as well as [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for type checking. Please ensure that your code passes all of these checks before submitting a pull request expecting to be merged.

## Lazy Contributing

If you're feeling lazy and don't want to go through the necessary checks such as linting and type checking, you may still submit a pull request. However, it will be marked as `WIP` and will not be merged until all checks have passed. This is to ensure that the codebase remains consistent and clean.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please open an issue on GitHub with a clear and detailed description of the feature you would like to see, including any potential use cases.

### Improving Documentation

### Contributing Code

If you are interested in contributing code, please follow the guidelines below.

## Development Setup

### Forking the Repository

First, fork the repository to your GitHub account.

### Cloning Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shuttleai.git
cd shuttleai
```

### Setting Up the Environment

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. To install poetry, run the following command:

```sh
pip install poetry
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Running Checks

We use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting as well as [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for type checking. To run all checks, run the following command:

```sh
poetry run ruff format . --check && poetry run mypy .
```

### Running Tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing. To run all tests, run the following command:

```sh
poetry run pytest .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tests will fail if the API key is not set. To set the API key, create a file called `.env` in the root of the project and add the following line:

> ```sh
> SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
> ```
