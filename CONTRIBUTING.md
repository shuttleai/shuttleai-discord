# Contributing to ShuttleAI

Thank you for considering contributing to the ShuttleAI project! Your contributions, whether bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, or code, are invaluable.

**We need your help with adding previous endpoints to the new wrapper!**

The ShuttleAI Python SDK uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting, and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for type checking. Ensure your code passes all checks before submitting a pull request.

## Benefits
Top contributors receive a special role in the [ShuttleAI Discord Server](https://discord.gg/shuttleai).

## Lazy Contributing
You can submit a pull request without passing checks, but it will be marked as `WIP` and not merged until all checks pass.
